# ProjectTwinStick
Twin stick shooter built in unity

This Project is mainly intended for me to learn how the unity engine works.
The goal is to build a functional twin stick shooter with the following features from scratch.


Primary Features :
	- Twin stick movement and shooting gameplay
	- Enemies spanning in waves with increasing difficulty
	- Multiple enemy types (like 5 maybe?) with different behaviours
	- Upgrade system for player
	- Score for eliminated enemies
	- Main menu with basic functions
	- Sound effects and music (not including making sound and music itself)
	- Particle effects (impact, explosions etc.)
	
Secondary (optional) Features:
	- Scoreboard
	- Synergistic weapon upgrades / projectile changes (e.g. beam, seeker missile etc.)
	- Shop mechanic where player can buy health/ upgrades etc. for points in between waves.
	- Boss enemy
